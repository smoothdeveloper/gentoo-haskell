		Cipher-aes128 is an implementation of AES and common modes of operation.  It borrows Hanquez&#39;s C AES code (see &#39;cipher-aes&#39;) but
		is unique due to including compile-time detection of
		NI compiler support, a slightly more functional interface
		for GCM operations, exposure of &#39;Ptr&#39; based operations via the .Internal module, and build-in crypto-api support.
		Cipher-aes128 was originally developed as &quot;&#39;cipher-aes&#39; plus trampolines&quot;, which has since been adopted into cipher-aes.
